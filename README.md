# Real-Time-Human-Gender-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a real-time human gender detection application using an [optimized Darknet Library](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Real-Time-Human-Gender-Detection/tree/master/Gender_Detection_GPU/src). This optimized form of the darknet library was created for testing phase only.
For accurate detection of faces closer or farther from the camera, YOLOv3 architecture was used for training the model on a modified [FDDB dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/).
