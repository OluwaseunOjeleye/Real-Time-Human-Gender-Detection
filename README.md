# Real-Time-Human-Gender-Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a real-time face detector and gender classifier using an [optimized Darknet Library](https://github.com/OluwaseunOjeleye/Real-Time-Human-Gender-Detection/tree/master/Gender_Detection_GPU/src). This optimized version of the darknet library was created for inference only. For accurate detection of faces closer or farther from the camera, the model was created by applying transfer learning using YOLOv3, and training on a modified [FDDB dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/).
